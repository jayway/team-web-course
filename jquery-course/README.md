# JQuery Lab

## Instructions

In this directory you will find a number of Javascript files along with some
tests. The object of this lab is to get all the tests to pass.

* Open `tests.html` in a browser.
* Open up the Javascript files in an editor.
* Edit the source files, *not the tests*, until all the tests pass.
* Detailed instructions are in the source files.

* When you come to the last part, *Ajax*, make sure that the `tests.html` file is
  served by a server and *not from the filesystem*. If you serve the files from
  the filesystem you will get crappy error messages, such as `Script Error...`
